## About This Project

This project aims to showcase the capabilities of GANs in generating realistic-looking human faces. The generated faces are produced by a GAN model trained on the CelebA dataset, which contains images of various celebrities.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Explore the project files and directories, including the generated images in the `templates` folder.

## Master Terminal Access

For access to the master terminal, run the following command:
```
ssh username@yourserver.com
```

Replace `username` with your username and `yourserver.com` with your server address.
