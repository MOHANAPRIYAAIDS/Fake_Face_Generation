# Fake Face Generation using GAN

This project focuses on generating fake faces using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on the CelebA dataset from Kaggle.

## Dataset

The CelebA dataset contains face images of various celebrities. You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset).

## Environment Setup

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Flask

You can install the dependencies using pip:

pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib


If your environment is not optimal for training the GAN, you can preprocess the images to the desired dimensions. 

## How GAN Works

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator generates fake images, while the discriminator evaluates these images to distinguish between real and fake ones. Both networks are trained simultaneously in a game-like setting, where the generator aims to generate more realistic images to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator aims to correctly classify real and fake images.

## Usage

To train the GAN on the CelebA dataset, follow these steps:

1. Download the CelebA dataset from Kaggle.
2. Preprocess the images if necessary.
3. Train the GAN using the provided scripts.
4. Generate fake faces using the trained GAN.

For detailed usage instructions, refer to the documentation in the codebase.
